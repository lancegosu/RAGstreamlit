# LLM Optimization with RAG, a Streamlit App

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) optimizes the output of an LLM by using external data to generate a response.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Connects user data with an LLM.

- **LLM Optimization**: Optimizes advanced indexing, vector store embeddings, and retrieval mechanisms

- **File Upload**: Temporarily stores user uploaded files to interact with the RAG system.

**APIs**: OpenAI API

**Libraries**: LangChain
